# OctoPrint-Longpathsdlist

Shows long file names in the SD List

## Setup

or manually using this URL:

## Warning

When too many files are present on the SD card the serial communication could be overflooded. This could result in the printer pausing while printing over USB for a few seconds at most. Use at your own risk!
